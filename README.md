# Techdegree Unit 01 Random Quote Generator Project

UPDATE - Grade recieved exceeds expetations

# Grade attempting for - Exceeds Expectations - Please see description below:

Requirements for Grading:

# Create Array of Objects:

To meet expectations for the project one must hit the following guidelines. 
(Exceeding expectations not possible in this category)

- Array of objects is named quotes.
- Array contains at least 5 quote objects.
- Array is free of errors.

To my better knowledge the array of objects has hit all criteria and I made more than 5 array abjects for the quotes array, I also made and extra array of colors to be used in gerating random colors for the background changing.

# Quote Objects:

To exceed expectations for the project one must hit the following guidelines.

- Objects in array include at least quote and source properties.
- At least one object in array includes citation property.
- At least one object in array includes year property.
- Objects in array include additional properties, such as categorization tags
- Additional properties are displayed on screen when present in quote object.

The quotes object in my project all contain the following properties:
- {`_id`} - Identifies position in the array 
- {`quote`} - Quote from the movie
- {`source`} - Character that made the quote
- {`actor`} - Star that played the role
- {`citation`} - Movie that the citation is from
- {`year`} - Year the movie was released
- {`used`} - Keyword mark to change boolean value of true/false. (will be used in future versions, not currently in use)
- {`tag`} - Category that identifies which type of film it is.

Quote, Source, Actor, Citation, Year and Tag are all displayed on screen and I manipulated the CSS to be able to distiguish them from the other parts by adding "Star" and "Actor" as it dynamically changes.

# `getRandomQuote` function:

To meet expectations one must achieve the following.
(exceeding expectations is unavailable in this category)

- Function is named getRandomQuote and returns a random object from the quotes array.

This function achieves this, and I also mimicked this when creating the random color function to be used in the setInterval timeout for changing the colors of the background.

# `printQuote` function:

To exceed expectations one must achieve the following.

- Function is named printQuote
- It calls the getRandomQuote function.
- It prints the quote to the page using the example HTML string format.
- Quotes change automatically after a certain amount of time passes.
- Background color changes each time the quote changes.

I have built functions that are congruent with the following demands, the printQuote function prints the quote to the screen and this will also change the background color.
There is also a set Interval timer that will change the quote automatically and the background color after 8 seconds pass.

# Code comments

To meet expectations in this category one must achieve the following.
(exceeding expectations is unavailable in this particular category)

- Comments are included in the code.

I have made sure to be very detailed in my code comments this way the functions are explained with what they do, the parameters involved. What is contained in the Object and arrays is also thoroughly explained. This way any other individual reading the code will be able to understand it without any issues.

I also included links ot the wikipedia page as to where i was getting the quotes from and sources of information to build the projects at the top of the javaScript file. Please see it below in case you would like to reference.
